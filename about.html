  <div class="aboutme-description">
    <p> I’m a UX Designer from Chicago and here is a little bit about me. I started my higher educational career as an English major at the University of Missouri. I have always loved reading and writing, but I never knew what I would do past college. As an english major one of our biggest roles, besides reading and writing, was research. I read books and articles, watched movies and documentaries, and completed hundreds of hours of research. After 4 years of this constant research, I became rather good at it. As a UX Designer being able to compare and contrast multiple websites or applications helps make your website or application the best out there. You must be able to research what is currently working and what is not. UX Designers frequently utilize surveys to see what aspects of an application or website need to be included or excluded. While completing my English degree, we regularly had to compare all sorts of media to find differences and similarities, and routinely created surveys for our research based classes. My extensive research background within my English degree has helped me thrive in this portion of UX Design. </p>
    <p class="am2"> Once I graduated I moved to St. Louis and got a complacent job in the office of a sales company. I was happy with what I was doing but I came across a new problem: I knew it wasn’t what I wanted my future to look like. At this office job, I was known as the in house “IT” with IT being used very loosely. I didn’t know how to fix computers or programs, but I knew more than the average 40 year old that I was working with. I got the nickname “Google” after a few of my coworkers noticed once I couldn’t solve a problem with an application or the computer itself, I googled it (doesn’t everyone?) and solved it from there. I realized then that working in a sales office doing complacent work was not was not meant for me. My boss at the time had asked me to connect with the woman who would be designing and constructing our new website. I spoke with her on the phone and noticed that I had more questions for her about her job and how she works than I did about the website she was creating for us. At this moment I realized that working in web design was something that really interested me, and something with which I could possibly do very well. </p>
    <p> So after about a year and a half of office work, I started searching for school programs that I could use my research and minimal computer skills to do something with web design. I came across Bloc and discovered that although I didn’t, at the time, have any experience with web design, this program would help me grasp the knowledge I needed to become a UX Designer. </p>
